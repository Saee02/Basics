Opretions

C program to perform basic arithmetic operations of two numbers. 
Numbers are assumed to be integers and will be entered by the user.
In programming language, swapping of two numbers in c indicates swapping the values of two variables.
Consider that you have the variables var1 and var2. Var1 has a value of 20 and Var2 has a value of 40.
Therefore, after swapping, the values of var1 and var2 will be 40 and 20, respectively.
