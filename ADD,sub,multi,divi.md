Opretions

C program to perform basic arithmetic operations of two numbers. 
Numbers are assumed to be integers and will be entered by the user.

Alorithm
Start
Declare four integer variables first, second, add, subtract, and multiply.
Declare one float variable divide.
Read the value of first from the user.
Read the value of second from the user.
Add the values of first and second and store the result in add.
Subtract the value of second from first and store the result in subtract.
Multiply the values of first and second and store the result in multiply.
Divide the value of first by the value of second, typecasting second to float to avoid integer division, and store the result in divide.
Print the value of add as "Sum = add".
Print the value of subtract as "Difference = subtract".
Print the value of multiply as "Multiplication = multiply".
Print the value of divide as "Division = divide" with two decimal places.
End.
